<h2>IEEE UVCE</h2>
<p>
IEEE UVCE is an IEEE student branch under the aegis of IEEE Bangalore     Section. This branch revived in 2001, is a titan in its own right with its astute commitment to the cause of furthering the dissemination of      knowledge which is reflected by the gamut of activities organized.            Symposiums, guest lectures, KAGADA- the National Level Paper Presentation Contest, IMPETUS- the National Level Technical Fest and intra-collegiate activities- RIPPLES are some of the events held all through the year. Testimony to the fact that we've been incessantly working for the student community, we've won several awards at the Bangalore Section of IEEE which include the Best Student Branch Award, Best Student Volunteer Award and Best Student Branch Website Award. Our counselor has won the Best Branch Counselor Award and Best Volunteer Service Award. The major aim of IEEE UVCE is to provide technical support to students by means of workshops, seminars, fun technical events and competitions in trending technological fields. Our members have won laurels at prestigious competitions, presented papers at renowned conferences and have been very active at IEEE Bangalore section level as well. Besides these, IEEE UVCE has 11 Special Interest Groups. For instance Avishkar, the research wing of IEEE UVCE, which has been publishing several technical papers every year in the fields of Data Mining, Image Processing, Networks and Security.

IMPETUS is a technical fest designed for a change and with vivid difference. Unlike other fests, every year this fest goes out with a message for the engineers. IMPETUS 2009 was focused at spreading environmental awareness among engineers. In the year 2010, the fest was themed with women empowerment and in 2011, it stood to assess the effect of IT in Bangalore. In 2012, the fest was themed after Engineering for Society followed by Innovation and Entrepreneurship in 2013 and previous version being centered on Importance of Research and Development.

<h2>Impetus 15.0 Theme - Internet of Things</h2>
<p>
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vision. It is being built today. This is the beginning of rethinking the computing paradigm. IoT is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing Internet infrastructure. IoT is a computing concept that describes a future where everyday physical objects will be connected to the Internet and be able to identify themselves to other devices
</p>
<p>
The Internet of Things is an emerging field yet to reach the consciousness of the masses. IoT has turned out to be the most trending topic in the present times of the technological industry that is going to revolutionize many concepts of our lives.
</p>
The kinds of innovation that we've seen with mobile devices and their ability to leverage sensing and communication capabilities are small preview of what's coming with the Internet of Things and will have a broad impact across industries. IoT has the potential to significantly change industries such as healthcare, energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation. Innovation and discovery of new technologies like IoT are transforming the world at lightning speed. Today with every profession being interwoven with technology irrespective of the field, it becomes quite essential for every professional or engineer to be apprised about these concepts. Through Impetus and all the various events centered on the theme, it is our attempt to make the to-be engineers more aware of the concept of IoT.
